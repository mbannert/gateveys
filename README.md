An R Toolbox for Business Tendency Survey Researchers

gateveys stands for aggre**gate** sur**veys** and should help survey researchers to aggregate qualitative
participant level data. This is typically done during the analysis of business tendency surveys and thus addresses
researchers, though it might be helpful for other researchers too. 

Feel free to use the package, but be warned it's my first ever R package and also my first push to github. 
Obviously I am very happy about any feedback that helps to improve the package. Will soon drop a paper containing some
examples. 

if you have any questions just sent me an email.
